# ChatAgent
OOP Project for the INSA Toulouse

This repository contains the whole messaging project with the source code as well as a zipped file containing a functioning version of the Chat Agent.

To set up the application for the first time, you need to extract the ChatAgent_Release.zip (or .rar) file. 
Once this is done, open a terminal in the extracted file directory, and type in the following command: "java -jar ChatAgent.jar".
Please make sure you have a proper JRE/JDK (the most recent version should do it) set up on your computer, or else you will not be able to use the app. You have the possibility to move the extracted file wherever you want in your directories. 
For a detailed step by step guide on how to use the app, please refer to the report included in the repository.
